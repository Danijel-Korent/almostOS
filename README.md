# almostOS
Something almost but not quite entirely unlike OS. It's at very early stage. It boots, but currently it can only output text to screen and read the input from the keyboard. I'm not sure in which direction I will go with this project, but I will definitely at least implement ATA driver and some file system parser. Had only tested it on Bosch x86 PC emulator, but in theory it should also boot on VirtualBox/VMWare.

#### It's ugly, but not ugly enough to be rejected by GRUB
