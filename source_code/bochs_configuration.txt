# NOTES ON BOCHS BIOS:
#
# Although BIOS-bochs-legacy is supposedly only needed for i386 emulator (ours is running x86_64), and BIOS-bochs-latest
# downloaded from APT on multiple distros worked just fine - on the Lubuntu 21.04. it tripple faults as soon as BIOS
# starts running. It only manages to log "Starting rombios32" & "Shutdown flag 0" before faulting. The one fetched from
# APT on Lubuntu 20.04. works just fine.
#
# Lubuntu 21.04. fetches APT package "bochsbios 2.6.11+dfsg-4" (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/hirsute/amd64/bochsbios/2.6.11+dfsg-4)
# Lubuntu 20.04. fetches APT package "bochsbios 2.6.11+dfsg-1build1" (https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/groovy/amd64/bochsbios/2.6.11+dfsg-1build1)
#
# On both OSes Bochs version is identical:
#    Bochs x86 Emulator 2.6.11
#      Built from SVN snapshot on January 5, 2020
#      Timestamp: Sun Jan  5 08:36:00 CET 2020
#
# Both BIOSes are at /usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, and they also appear the same by checking internal strings

# Although the strings in both BIOS firmware binaries say the same number and date, by looking at rest of binary, they
# obviusly differ. E.g. BIOS firmware from 21.04. have some checks in ACPI tables that one for 20.04. doesn't have (RSDT, FACP, HPET)
#
# NOTE: Bochs docu says that legacy BIOS is "without 32-bit init code" (https://bochs.sourceforge.io/doc/docbook/user/rom-images.html).
#       I assume that means that it lefts CPU in real mode instead of protected mode. But then I don't understand how
#       the same GRUB image/instructions bahve correctly in both 16-bit and 32-bit mode. Maybe there is some hackery in place
#
# TODO: Maybe it would be smart to upload BIOSes to the repo and use those in this config. It would give some stability
